<h3>THIRD ARTICLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> our last paper we spoke of the choice of a
sick-room; we shall now proceed to discuss its
management. In commencing to nurse a case
that promises to be anything like lengthy, it is
well to consider how to save unnecessary dust
and unnecessary labour, whilst keeping the room
in its proper state of cleanliness. With this end
in view, heavy woollen draperies, retaining dust
and bad smells, should be avoided; and if curtains
are used at all, they should be of lace, or
some light, washing material. The best chairs are
those with simple wooden frames and cane seats
and backs. Should a sofa be necessary, and a
regular invalid couch not procurable, nothing
is better than a chair-bed—provided it does not
creak—fitted with washing-covers to its cushions.
Much has been said for and against the use of
carpets in a sick-room; and taking all into consideration,
we see no reason for changing our
opinion that, in ordinary cases, it is better to
let them remain; they make a room pleasanter
and more natural, and do away with the noise
of scrubbing, incidental to a boarded floor.</p>

<p>If there are cupboards, they should be cleaned
out before beginning to nurse, and in no case
must they be used as receptacles for food or
for anything that has become soiled in using.
A chest of drawers is a comfort if used with
discretion; but in home-nursing, it often proves
the reverse of useful, and serves as a treasury
for all sorts of things which have no business
in a sick-room.</p>

<p>Pictures have a brightening effect, but they
must hang straight, or your patient may worry
himself with endless efforts to make them fit
in with the pattern of the paper; though, if
possible, the paper should be without those
decided markings which so often add to the distress
of unduly sensitive nerves.</p>

<p>Growing-plants have a cheerful look, and are
not deleterious, as many suppose; cut flowers
may also be indulged in, with the exception of
those which have a heavy, sickly smell; but it
is better to remove them at night. In summer,
it is necessary to take precaution against the
patient’s being disturbed by the buzz of insects;
a fly-catcher at the open window will generally
be sufficient; but such things in the room itself
are worse than useless.</p>

<p>Small washable ornaments may be allowed
to remain, but not to a greater extent than
suffices to give the room its customary appearance,
for it must be remembered that all useless
articles increase the number of dust-receptacles
and make the process of tidying-up more lengthy.
I have seen mantel-boards and brackets covered
with cloth, and literally crowded with ornaments,
which have not been properly dusted
for weeks because it made the patient sneeze!
Such instances point the moral in regard to
cloth-coverings as well as superfluous ornaments.</p>

<p>A folding-screen is an almost indispensable
article of sick-room furniture; it not only serves
to keep off draughts and the glare of the fire,
but in convalescence is useful for putting round
the invalid’s chair. By its help, too, ventilation
is made so much easier, that, if nothing pretty
and ornamental is to be had, it is worth while
to extemporise a screen with an ordinary clothes-horse
and sheet; but a chintz or holland cover,
bound with braid and made to tie on, is
much more cheerful than the dull expanse of
a sheet.</p>

<p>And now for the most important article of
furniture, the bed, on which depends so much
of the patient’s comfort or discomfort. If possible,
have a light iron frame without a foot-rail,
or with only a low one. For an adult,
the bed should measure not less than six feet
three inches in length and about three feet in
width. Greater width increases the difficulty of
reaching the patient, and it is astonishing the
journeys such a thing as a handkerchief will
make over a large surface of bed. The height<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">{610}</span>
of the bed is another serious consideration, for
should it be too low, the nurse will find it
add considerably to the back-aching tendency
of nursing; and if too high, the constant straining
up to the patient will be quite as bad. The
rule then, is, that the bed when made shall
be so proportioned to the nurse’s height as to
enable her to lift and attend to the patient
without any undue effort. In home-nursing,
the bed question is often overlooked altogether,
or made much more of a difficulty than it need
be; and though that relic of unenlightened days,
the four-poster, is almost extinct in some households,
most of the beds are large, and to alter
the furnishing of a room seems beyond the
imagination of the ordinary housekeeper. But
surely, in time of illness, the first consideration
should be how best to mitigate the patient’s
sufferings and lighten the nurse’s labours; and
in all but quite slight cases, it is worth considerable
effort to secure the right kind of
bed and bedding. This brings us to another
home-nursing difficulty; for in spite of recent
progress in hygienic knowledge, there are still
not a few individuals who are foolish enough to
prefer the unwholesome softness of a feather-bed
to the healthy firmness of a good hair mattress.
Yet few victims to this enervating habit fail to
complain of the lumps, only to be got rid of
by a large expenditure of strength and time.
And if this be so in ordinary life, how much
more complicated do matters become when the
patient is too weak to bear to be removed for
the necessary shaking, and is yet in a state to
feel every discomfort with added force. Indeed,
so true is this, that in serious illness, a feather-bed
may be reckoned as an invincible enemy to
comfort and cleanliness; and it is better not to
allow your patient to remain under such unfavourable
circumstances, even though it involve
a few hours of dissatisfied grumbling. It may
make things easier if the change is ushered in
by allowing the feather-bed to remain under the
mattress till the patient has become accustomed
to the new order of things, when it will be well
to substitute flock for feathers.</p>

<p>If the nurse’s height will allow of two mattresses,
it is a good plan to alternate them so
that the under one of yesterday shall be the
upper one of to-day. Those who have not tried
this simple way of securing a change, will hardly
believe the comfort it affords to a helpless
patient.</p>

<p>On the same principle, it is a great alleviation
to the monotony of long illness if the room
will allow of two beds, one for day, the other
for night; and this arrangement permits the
thorough airing of bed and bedding, which it
is otherwise so difficult to secure.</p>

<p>Bed-hangings are happily following the lead
of the ancient four-poster, and will soon be only
remembered as things of the past; and in illness,
even the valance, still in use, had better be
banished. Pillows should be firm and not too
soft; and bolsters should have covers of their
own, and not be rolled round in the under-sheet,
according to a common and very shiftless process.
I have known the sheet to be tucked round the
bolster in such a careless way that by the patient’s
merely getting into bed it has been pulled out
of place, and has continued a fruitful source of
irritation for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>How to keep the under-sheet smooth and free
alike from crumbs and wrinkles is one of the
professed nurse’s arts, and is just one of those
apparently small matters, neglected as such by
inexperience, which make home-nursing the unsatisfactory
thing it often is. Yet those who
have gone through a tedious illness can hardly
fail to remember the discomfort of what a tiny
patient used to call ‘rucks.’ To him, poor little
man, rucks made stopping in bed a misery; and
his incessant demands to have them removed,
suggested to even his inexperienced nurse the
idea that there might be a right and a wrong
way to such a commonplace thing as bed-making.
The right and only proper way of arranging a
bed for illness is to give special, minute attention
to the placing of under-blanket and sheet. If
the former can be dispensed with, especially in
summer-time, it will be well; but very few
patients will agree to this, and it is hardly of
sufficient importance to argue about, except in
special cases, when the doctor will probably give
his veto.</p>

<p>In an ordinary way, be careful to choose a
thin blanket, without holes of course, but one
that has been pretty well worn, and that, therefore,
will not greatly add to the heat of the
patient’s body. Then—more important still—the
blanket must be considerably larger than the bed,
in length as well as width. The mattress being
arranged as evenly as possible, the under-blanket
should be laid upon it, and well tucked in at
top and bottom, as well as sides, till there is not
a crease or wrinkle of any sort. The under-sheet
must now be put on in the same way, and the
nearer it resembles a drum in tightness the better.
A few minutes spent in extra care at this point
will save the patient hours of discomfort later
on.</p>

<p>Should there, unfortunately, be no covered
bolster, the sheet, after being securely tucked in
at the bottom, must be drawn tightly upwards,
and the bolster rolled round in the free end and
then placed well up against the bed-head. The
difficulty is to get the sheet tightly stretched
without pulling the bolster away from its proper
place. The number of pillows must be regulated
by the nature of the patient’s malady and partly
by his previous habits. In ordinary cases, one
large pillow is enough, and it is a good plan to
place it lengthways, one end resting against the
bed-head, and the other on the mattress, thus
avoiding the hollow between the patient’s shoulders
and the bed, which is a fruitful source of uneasiness
and restlessness. In convalescence and in
many forms of illness, pillows play an important
part, and we shall have more to say about them
later on.</p>

<p>We now return to the bed, furnished as far
as the under-sheet and pillow. Should the patient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">{611}</span>
be quite helpless, it will be necessary to place
next, the contrivance known as a draw-sheet,
which should consist of old linen or calico that
has been washed to extreme softness. It should
be folded lengthways till just long enough to reach
from below the patient’s shoulders to his knees.
This, with an under-piece of mackintosh, is carefully
put in place and tucked in with the same
care and tightness as the under-sheet.</p>

<p>In regard to the upper bed-clothes, they too
require care in tucking in, especially at the
bottom; and if so long as to need folding back,
the folding must on no account be done at the
top. I have seen patients with chest complaints
literally labouring under the weight of clothes
placed in exactly the wrong place. In illness,
as a rule the feet need extra covering, and the
breathing organs no more weight of clothes than
is absolutely necessary. The upper-sheet being
light, may be allowed to turn over for neatness,
but blanket and counterpane must only come up
to the patient’s neck. This folding back is such
a common error, that it needs special notice, and
in ordinary life, as well as in illness, should never
be tolerated. The number of upper-clothes to
be put on the patient’s bed will vary with circumstances;
but, as a rule, in a room with a fire, one
blanket and a counterpane will be enough. The
great point is to secure warmth without weight,
and for this purpose, the ordinary cotton counterpane
is about as bad as possible. An excellent
substitute is the kind of blanket known as the
‘Austrian,’ which is cheerful in appearance as well
as light and warm. In cases of exhaustion,
nothing is better than a chintz-covered down,
which can be shifted or removed without disturbing
the patient.</p>

<p>A good many amateur nurses err on the side
of over-heating a patient, and do not understand
its connection with restless tossing and broken
sleep. Should these symptoms occur at night,
especially if accompanied with a flushed face and
moist skin, it is well to gradually reduce the
number of coverings, carefully noticing the effect
of so doing.</p>

<p>On the ground of their greater warmth, cotton
sheets and pillow-cases are preferable to linen;
but some people have a decided fancy for the
latter, and it may safely be used, provided the
sheets are warmed just before being put on the
bed. Simple airing is not enough; I have
known the chill of linen set a patient off into
a shivering fit, although the nurse has been particularly
strong in the airing line.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary that all the bedding
used in illness shall be thoroughly aired, but, of
course, it should never be done in the sick-room.
Unhappily, it is by no means rare to find the
fire screened from a patient by clothes-horse or
chairs, covered with damp things, the vapour from
which ought to be sufficient warning of the folly
of such a practice. A good rule in this connection
is that everything, down to cups and saucers,
shall be removed from the sick-room as soon as
soiled, and only returned to it in a condition
for immediate use.</p>

<p>Re-making the patient’s bed is our next consideration.
If well enough to go into another
room, he should either be carried there, or laid
on a sofa and wheeled in. As soon as he is out
of the way, the window of the sick-room should
be thrown open to its widest, and the bed-clothes
taken off one by one, well shaken, and left so
exposed that the air can circulate freely around
them. The mattresses should share the same
treatment, and if possible, be left for a few
minutes before being replaced. The patient will
indeed be peculiar who does not enjoy the
refreshment of a bed thus aired.</p>

<p>But in helpless illness, the changing of bedding
is a more complicated matter, and needs practice
to make perfect. There are two ways of changing
the under-sheet The first may be used when
the patient is not quite helpless, and the nurse
has to work alone. The soiled sheet is freed at
the top, and after the removal of pillows and
bolster, is rolled up to the patient’s head; the
clean sheet, after being well tucked in at the top,
is loosely rolled in such a way as to lie close
against the soiled one; they must now be worked
down together, rolling the soiled, and unrolling
the clean, the patient raising himself on elbows
and feet just enough for the nurse to pass the
sheets under him. In this way it is possible to
get the under-sheet smooth and tight; but it is
not an easy thing, and an assistant should be had
if possible. If help is to be had, and in all cases
where the patient is quite powerless, it is better
to adopt the second plan. Remove the pillows
and bolster, so that the patient lies quite flat
in bed; turn him over on his side with his
back to you. Loosen the sheet lengthways, and
proceed with the rolling and unrolling as before,
till the rolls come close up to the patient’s
back. Depress the mattress under him, whilst
the assistant draws the sheet through, and in so
doing, slowly turns the patient on his back. He
will now be lying on the clean sheet, and the
difficulty is over. The trained nurse will be able
to do this without removing the upper clothing,
and in no case should all the coverings be taken
away. Draw-sheets may be removed in the same
way, but being small, are easier to manage. Some
people tack or pin the clean to the dirty, and draw
through whilst an assistant keeps the patient raised.
Changing the upper clothes is not such a serious
undertaking, though seldom properly managed
by amateurs. The counterpane and blanket may
be taken quite off the bed, and given to an
assistant to shake, outside the room; but the
sheet must never be removed without an immediate
substitute. A good plan is to loosen the
soiled sheet all round, tuck the clean one well
in at the foot, and draw the free end upwards,
under the dirty sheet, which is gradually drawn
away or rolled up. As a general rule, the
patient’s bed should be made and his night-shirt
changed at least once a day, and cases where this
is not feasible ought not to come within the scope
of home-nursing.</p>

<p>If a pair of clean sheets a day cannot be
managed, one may be made to do, by letting
yesterday’s clean upper sheet be to-day’s lower
one; but draw-sheets must be changed as soon as
soiled, irrespective of number. Where mackintosh
is used, it should also be frequently changed,
washed over, and thoroughly dried, in the open
air if possible.</p>

<p>The patient’s bed, it will be seen from the
directions for making it, must never stand so
that one side is against the wall, nor must it be
in a direct current of air; but it is well if it can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">{612}</span>
be so arranged as to face the fire and at the same
time allow the patient to amuse himself by
looking out of window. In badly finished houses,
there is often considerable draught from cracks
in door or window frame, and from this the
patient must be carefully guarded by the judicious
use of screens.</p>

<p>We now turn to consider how the sick-room
may be kept in that state of perfect cleanliness
essential alike to the patient’s comfort and
recovery; and of all neglected points, this is
perhaps the one most frequently forgotten or
ignored; not one in a hundred of home-nurses
having a conception of her duty in this respect.
Difficult it undoubtedly is; but where the
patient can be removed to another room for an
hour or two once a week, it is quite possible for
even inexperience to be successful.</p>

<p>We will suppose the weekly removal has taken
place, and the nurse has to make hay while the
sun shines. She first strips the bed, sending the
clothes into another room to be aired; and
throwing the window open to its widest, she
directs her attention to the grate. The best way
of removing the ashes is to carefully collect all
the large pieces of coal and cinder, and then
very gently draw the ashes away into a piece of
stiff paper, which folded over them, will prevent
any dust rising in their transit. After cleaning
grate and fire-irons and making up the fire, the
nurse turns her attention to the carpet, which,
after being well strewn with damp tea-leaves,
should be briskly swept with a hand-broom. If
the furniture is simple, it may be washed over
with a wet cloth and dried, all cushions or stuffed
furniture being beaten out of the room. The
window, often overlooked, should be nicely
cleaned; and then the bed being re-made, the
patient may be brought back into a room
thoroughly well cleaned and aired. It is not
necessary that a nurse should herself perform all
menial work; indeed, it is much better she should
not; but she ought to see that the above directions
are faithfully carried out. For the rest of
the week, the carpet should be wiped over with
a damp (not wet) cloth, tied to the end of a long
broom, and the furniture well and quickly dusted.
It is not enough to merely wipe over furniture
and let the dust loose; the duster should be
folded over bit by bit as it becomes soiled, and
once or twice during the process of dusting,
shaken out of a window in another room or in
the staircase. A room thus treated will keep in
perfect order for some time; but should the
illness be long, an effort must be made to take
the carpet up about every six weeks or two
months, that it may be beaten and thoroughly
aired. If carpets are made in the sensible fashion
of squares, secured by brass nails with broad
heads, there will be little difficulty in managing
this; but it will not hurt the carpet to let it
remain loose.</p>

<p>In cases where the weekly removal is impossible,
the floor must be wiped over carefully
every day with a damp cloth, and tea-leaves
used now and then, the patient being protected
from the dust by screens; but this plan is only
for use as a last resource in extreme cases.
Under such circumstances, it is not a bad plan
to have a small portion of the furniture, say a
chair or table and an ornament or two, removed
each day and thoroughly cleaned, out of the
room; otherwise, it is almost impossible to keep
things in proper order, in spite of daily
dusting.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.—ANXIETIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Madge</span> wakened with the weary sensation of
one who has passed through a long nightmare.
It was some minutes before she could recall the
incidents of the previous day; still longer before
she could realise the unhappy meaning of the
scene with Philip, and the fact that Uncle Dick
and Aunt Hessy had found in her conduct cause
for grave displeasure.</p>

<p>Surely she had been acting very wickedly,
when those three, who were dearer to her than
all the world beside, turned from her, and were
vexed as well as pained by what she was doing,
so far as they understood it. Surely Mr Beecham
must be mistaken in the course he was pursuing—she
did not even now doubt the goodness and
generosity of his motives. There was only one
way in which she could set the minds of her
friends at ease; and that she must adopt, no
matter what it might cost herself. She dare
not hope that Philip would be readily satisfied
and come back to her; but at least he should
understand that she had been thinking of his
interest more than of herself. And Uncle Dick
and Aunt Hessy would be relieved from anxiety
on her account, and then—who could tell?—maybe
they would influence Philip. Maybe
Uncle Dick would overlook his loss of fortune,
and tell him that he never meant to separate
them on such a sorry score as that.</p>

<p>The one way which she saw to bring about
this desirable consummation was to inform Mr
Beecham that she could no longer keep his
secret; and that, if he did not come to Willowmere
within the week to release her, she would
take back the pledge she had given him and
explain everything to her relatives.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this resolution, she was
restored to a calm state of mind which was wonderful
in contrast with the fever of the night.
Morning is the time of hope and energy to a
healthful nature; and Madge felt this, although
the atmosphere was cold and the sky white with
its load of snow, which was presently to descend
in thick flakes, covering up the last patches of
earth and shrub left bare by the glimpses of sunshine
that had succeeded the previous fall.</p>

<p>She went about her duties quietly and resolutely;
but it was hard to meet the wistful eyes
of Dame Crawshay without throwing herself into
the arms that would have received her so gladly,
and at once tell all. She had, however, made
a bargain, and she would keep to it. Aunt
Hessy would approve of what she was doing,
when the time for explanation came. Uncle
Dick was surly at breakfast, and he scarcely
spoke to her at dinner. He did not once refer
to the cattle show, and he went out to inspect
his stock, a discontented and unhappy man.</p>

<p>Madge felt assured that Philip would say
nothing more unless he heard from Uncle Dick;
nevertheless, she was all day looking out for
some sign from him. Old Zachy the postman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">{613}</span>
came twice, and she saw him approach, her
heart pausing, then beating quick with excitement.
But Zachy brought nothing from her
lover. And she was pained as well as disappointed,
although she assured herself again
that she had not expected anything, and that
she had no right to expect anything until Philip
received some token of Uncle Dick’s kindly
intentions. Besides, she argued, it was needful
to bear in mind the distracted state he was in
about his affairs, and how many things he must
have to attend to which could not be postponed
on any account. Indeed, she did remember all
this, and was so keenly sensible of the cruel
effect his misfortunes were producing on his
mind, that she was frightened about him—more
frightened than she had been even on the
occurrence of the accident with the horse.</p>

<p>So, when postman Zachy had made his second
and last round in the afternoon, she could not
rest until she had consulted Dr Joy regarding
Philip’s health. Having explained to Aunt
Hessy where she was going and why, she started
for the village, although the snow had begun to
fall in a way which would have made any
town-miss who understood what the signs meant
glad to stay at home. What the snow meant
was to fulfil the threats it had been making for
several days, and to come down more heavily
than it had done for years.</p>

<p>Dr Joy was surprised to see her on such a
gloomy afternoon; but he understood the nature
of her visit, after a few words of such necessary
explanation as she was at liberty to give.</p>

<p>‘And I want you to tell me plainly what his
condition is, doctor,’ she concluded, ‘for I—that
is, we are all very anxious about him.’</p>

<p>The good little doctor looked at her earnestly
for a moment, as if to assure himself that she was
not only desirous of hearing the truth but also
able to bear it, and then made reply frankly,
but was unable even then to dismount entirely
from the hobby which he and his wife rode so
diligently in theory.</p>

<p>‘You will agree with me, my dear Miss
Heathcote, that economy is the great principle
which should regulate our lives—not merely
economy in finance, but likewise in work, in
strength, and (most important of all) in health.
I daresay our friend has told you that I spoke
to him on this subject.’</p>

<p>‘When writing, he mentioned that you had
visited him,’ she answered, with some nervous
anticipations assailing her.</p>

<p>‘Well, I warned him then that his condition
was extremely precarious. It is, in fact, that
condition which when a man has fallen into, it
requires him directly to throw up everything, if
he cares to live. It requires him to sacrifice
fortune, prosperity, and to run away anywhere
and do anything to escape it.’</p>

<p>‘But how can he do that?’</p>

<p>Her own observations of Philip’s changing
moods recently, formed a convincing argument
in favour of the importance of what the doctor
said. The doctor shook his head and smiled
regretfully.</p>

<p>‘That is precisely what he asked; that is
what every man to whom the advice is given
asks. My answer is—<i>don’t</i> ask how, but go at
once. Your affairs will be settled much more
satisfactorily to all parties in a year or two if
you go, than they can be if you remain and die
in a month or two.’</p>

<p>‘But surely Philip is not so bad as that!’</p>

<p>‘You asked me to speak plainly, and I am
quoting extreme cases,’ said Dr Joy, anxious
to mitigate the alarm which he saw his verdict
had created, whilst at the same time holding
to his point. ‘Philip is not quite so bad as that
yet; but he will be in a few months, unless
something occurs to relieve him from his present
anxieties.’</p>

<p>The doctor’s last words gave her more
encouragement than he could have expected, or
perhaps intended to give; and the terror which
had made her pulse seem to stop, was changed
to confident hope. She had every reason to
believe that in a few weeks, it might be in
a few days, Philip would be relieved of all
his anxieties. But this did not lessen in any
degree her eagerness to have direct and frequent
information as to the state of his health. Dr
Joy readily agreed to call at the chambers in
Gray’s Inn on the following day, and report
to her on his return; then they were to arrange
about further visits. Thus being relieved to
some extent on this important point, she prepared
to take leave; but Dr and Mrs Joy
suggested that she should have a fly to take
her home, as the snow was falling fast, and
already lay three or four inches deep on the
ground, whilst it had drifted into an embankment
against the opposite houses.</p>

<p>‘I should not think of your hiring a conveyance,’
said the doctor; ‘but we have had a long
and heavy day, and both my horses are fagged
out.’</p>

<p>But Madge would not hear of this kindly
proposal. ‘I like the snow,’ she answered, ‘and
a brisk walk will do me good.’ At another
time, she would have smiled at the timidity of
her friends on account of the weather.</p>

<p>‘You will catch your death of cold, my dear,’
said Mrs Joy, ‘and then you will not be able
to come to Edwin’s lecture next week. I assure
you it is the most interesting one he has yet
delivered.’</p>

<p>Even the danger of missing the doctor’s lecture
was not enough to deter her from walking
home. As she was passing the <i>King’s Head</i>,
the Ringsford carriage drew up at the door, and
out of it jumped Coutts Hadleigh, in the full
uniform of a captain of Volunteers. He was
taken by surprise, and uttered a natural exclamation:</p>

<p>‘Why, what brings you so far from home on
such an evening as this? There is going to be
a regular out and outer of a snowstorm, and
I would not be here myself, only this is the
night of the feed I give every year to my
men, and all the arrangements were made.’</p>

<p>She was more pleased to meet him than
she was generally, for he might be able to
give her some news of Philip. So, without
troubling to answer his inquiries, she put her
own.</p>

<p>‘Don’t know anything about him,’ he answered—callously,
as she thought, ‘except that he has
got into a precious scrape, and will disgrace our
family, unless that uncle of his helps him out
of it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">{614}</span></p>

<p>‘Disgrace?—How is it disgrace to fail in a
noble enterprise?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, it’s something worse than failing in a
noble enterprise,’ answered Coutts, returning to
his habitual tone of cynical indifference. ‘But
don’t let us talk about it, if you please. I
would rather not, even to you, until all the
ins and outs are known.’</p>

<p>‘When will you know about your brother’s
affairs?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say; but he will tell you all about
them; and if he doesn’t, I will. Meanwhile, let
me do him a service—get into the carriage, and
Toomey will drive you home. I am sure that is
what Phil and the guv’nor, too, would say, if
they found you trudging along the road in such
weather. Do get in, or they will both have me
down in their black books. The carriage is
not to come back for me, so you won’t give the
horses any extra work.’</p>

<p>She consented; and Toomey, who was glad
enough to turn homeward for his own comfort
as well as that of the horses, wheeled round,
and drove off at a good pace. A little way
out of the village they nearly ran over a
man, who, walking in the same direction, had
not heard the carriage making up on him,
either on account of the preoccupation of his
thoughts or the thick carpeting of snow on
the road.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ growled the man, having saved
himself, and Toomey drove on.</p>

<p>Madge recognised the voice of Caleb Kersey.
She would have liked to speak to him, but it
was too late. She supposed, however, that he was
on his way to visit Sam Culver, from whom he
would learn the cause of Pansy’s disappearance.
Caleb was on this quest, as she surmised, and he
was going to Ringsford, but not to seek information
from the gardener.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.—AT MIDNIGHT.</h3>

<p>Coutts Hadleigh relished good wine; but he
was cautious in his cups, as in everything else.
On this evening, however, he ‘drank fair,’ as it
is called, with his comrades; and those who were
acquainted with his habits noted the fact with
increasing curiosity as the evening advanced.
This was the fifth annual dinner he had given
to ‘his men’ since the captain’s commission had
been thrust upon him, and he had on no previous
occasion displayed so much hilarity or provided
so many cynical anecdotes for the entertainment
of the company. His lieutenant and sub.—both
proprietors of the land they farmed—concluded
that the captain must have made some
exceptionally lucky stroke in business recently.
Coutts believed he had.</p>

<p>The members of the Kingshope Volunteer
corps were mostly young farmers and the sons
of farmers, who should have possessed the physical
proportions which would have specially
qualified them for the soldier’s career. But it
was surprising to observe how few of them presented
these qualifications. When Dick Crawshay
first saw them mustered, he exclaimed in
loud indignation, his huge form towering over
the whole troop: ‘What! is that all our county
can show in the way of Volunteers? Why, half
a dozen of our old yeomen would scare them into
the middle of next week without a tussle! They
are more like a set of town scarecrows than
country-bred lads.... Ah, this comes ov givin’
the land to people that have money and no
muscle, and meddle with things they know
nothing about.’</p>

<p>He was right in a certain degree, for these
youths were the sons of wealthy merchants who
take up farming as a hobby, and leaving the work
to hired labourers, are indifferent to losses, and
therefore able to pay rents which the working
farmer has struggled for a time to compete with,
and given up in despair, or emigrated. This was
a sore subject with yeoman Dick, and although
regularly invited by Coutts to this annual feast, he
regularly refused to go—and even kept within his
own bounds whenever he knew there was a parade.
The prejudice prevented him from learning that
a goodly number of these young fellows made
up for physical deficiencies by skill as marksmen
and efficiency in drill; so that the Kingshope
Volunteer corps formed a by no means
unsatisfactory body of men for home defence.
But had any one dared to hint that even in
some respects they might be favourably compared
with the old yeomanry, he would have made Dick
his foe.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, Captain Hadleigh’s
company showed that they had improved slightly
on one of the yeomanry practices by keeping
up their revels to a late hour without all getting
drunk. The lieutenant having to pass Ringsford
on his way home, and having his gig with him,
drove the captain to the gates of the Manor.
The snow had only ceased falling a little while
before the company at the <i>King’s Head</i> broke
up, and now it lay deep on the roads, houses,
and fields. The old church looked like a huge
snow-house; and the meadows in the dim moonlight
presented a white surface, apparently on a
level with the hedgerows.</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s powerful cob had its work to
do, for at every step its hoofs sank deep in
the snow-covered road. But the travellers were
merry, and did not mind the slowness of their
progress. Their chief trouble was to keep the
road and avoid the open ditches. They succeeded
in this, and also succeeded in distinguishing the
point where the Manor gates broke the white
wall.</p>

<p>Coutts made his way through the side-gate,
which shook large pancakes of snow down upon
him as he opened it.</p>

<p>The avenue being guarded by its long arch
of tree-branches, the path was comparatively easy
to traverse, and Coutts was soon in front of the
house, which, like the church, was a shapeless
white mass, broken by a few points of light.
Underneath these few lights was dark shadow.
As Coutts ascended the steps of the portico, a
man stepped out from the shadow.</p>

<p>‘I want to speak to you a minute, Mr Coutts
Hadleigh; I’ve been waiting all evening for
you.’</p>

<p>Coutts was no coward, although his brain
was somewhat muddy with wine; but this
sudden apparition made him spring to the top
of the steps and ring the bell, as he exclaimed
fiercely:</p>

<p>‘Who are you, and what do you want with me
at this hour?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">{615}</span></p>

<p>‘I want to know where is Pansy Culver?’
said the man with enforced calmness, which contrasted
to his advantage with the blustering ire
of the other.</p>

<p>‘Confound your impudence—how should I
know?’</p>

<p>‘I saw you with her at the London station.
Where has she gone to? Where did you send
her to?’</p>

<p>‘She didn’t tell me where she was going to,
and I didn’t send her anywhere.’</p>

<p>Caleb Kersey’s calmness broke bounds, and he
next spoke with savage determination:</p>

<p>‘You are lying, and you shall tell me the
truth.’</p>

<p>‘You’re an insolent fool.’</p>

<p>As Caleb swiftly ascended the steps, he received
a vigorous buffet on the breast, which tumbled
him backward on the snow. The door was open;
Coutts entered; the door was instantly closed,
bolted, chained, and locked.</p>

<p>‘Tell that fellow Kersey to go about his business,’
said Coutts to the attendant who had been
waiting up for him; ‘he is drunk or mad. If
he has any business with me, he knows where
to find me at proper hours.’</p>

<p>With that he went up-stairs in a furious temper
with the man who had insulted him, and had
evidently intended to offer violence to his person.
Before he had reached the first landing, there
was an impatient but not a very loud knock
at the door. The servant repeated his young
master’s message, put out the hall lights, and
gladly enough went off to bed.</p>

<p>Caleb stood in the portico hesitating as to what
he should do. He had been waiting there for
hours; he had been told that Mr Coutts Hadleigh
was not at home—the servant declined to say
where he might be found. The snow and the
cold did not appear to affect him. He waited,
and at last the man had come, but had not
given the watcher any satisfaction. Caleb was
aware that his application was untimely: but that
was not his fault: the circumstances were exceptional.
He must know from this villain what
he had done with Pansy, and then he would
seek her father, whose authority would rescue
her from the evil influence under which she had
fallen.</p>

<p>The poor fellow never thought that his first
step ought to have been to consult Pansy’s father.
A natural delicacy, rude and earnest, made him
shrink from the idea, because he felt sure it
would cause him pain. He learned from his
friends in the village that Pansy had gone away
somewhere; and as the gardener had no special
need or liking to speak of her grandfather, he
had not mentioned to any of his gossips whither
she had gone. So Caleb, sitting in a train which
was just starting, having caught sight of Pansy
and Coutts Hadleigh talking together on the
platform at Liverpool Street Station, instantly
concluded that there was something wrong. He
would have jumped out of the carriage; but
the other passengers prevented him, and he had
to endure cruel torments of speculation and
rage until he reached his destination.</p>

<p>He had no hope of winning Pansy; but he
might save her from the fate to which she seemed
to be hasting. He had no doubt she had been
taught to repeat some falsehood to her father,
which kept him quiet about her absence, and
he had no doubt of her danger. Then with a
sullen resolution, in which the anxiety of a lover
was combined with the suppressed fury of a
maniac, he sought Coutts Hadleigh, determined
to force the truth from him.</p>

<p>In those cold weary hours when he was hanging
about the Manor waiting, the words of
Philip frequently recurred to him: ‘Trust her,
man; trust her.’ He imagined that he did trust
her; he was sure that she did not mean to do
wrong. But at the same time the wicked comment
of Wrentham also presented itself, reminding
him that trust gave the woman opportunity to
deceive. He did not like the man who spoke
or the words he uttered; but the remembrance
made him uneasy.</p>

<p>‘Ah, if Master Philip had not been in such
a pickle with his own affairs, I’d have gone to
him now, and he would have told me what
was best to do, even though the villain be his
own brother. But it would be a mortal shame
to put more trouble on him when he’s down
enough already. I’ll go my own way.’</p>

<p>All these things were careering through his
mind, as he stood under the portico wondering
how he should act. He heard a casement open
above—it seemed to be directly over his head—and
Captain Hadleigh shouted:</p>

<p>‘You’d better move off quietly, Kersey, or
I’ll call our fellows and send for the police.’</p>

<p>The casement was closed violently, the two
sides banging together, the principal windows
of the Manor opening on hinges like doors, in
the French fashion.</p>

<p>Caleb stepped out from beneath the portico
and looked up. There was a ruddy glow—the
effect of the light shining through deep maroon-coloured
curtains—in two windows on the first
floor. One of these windows opened on to the top
of the portico which formed part of a balcony.
That was the one from which Hadleigh must have
spoken, thought Caleb; and was immediately
satisfied on the point by seeing the shadow of
a man who was passing slowly between the light
and the curtains.</p>

<p>‘The stable ain’t far off, and I can find a ladder
there,’ muttered Caleb, moving away from the
front of the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr Hadleigh, sen., was seated at his writing-table,
his back towards the windows. Before
him lay those sheets of manuscript which he had
written at intervals during the past year. The
broad shade on the lamp cast the soft light down
on the table, and had it not been for the bright
glow of a huge fire, the rest of the room—and
especially the upper part—would have been in
comparative darkness. As it was, the flickering
flame of the fire made the shadows above and
around him flutter and change like living
things.</p>

<p>He was not writing. He was carefully separating
certain pages from the others; having done
so, he fastened them together neatly, and with
his hand covering them, as if to hide the words
from himself, he leaned back on his chair.
Suddenly he rose and paced the floor slowly
in melancholy reflection.</p>

<p>When he resumed his seat, there was a placid
expression on his face, like that of one who, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">{616}</span>
a long mental struggle, has come to a final decision
and found peace.</p>

<p>With as much sad deliberation as if he were
committing a dear one to the grave, he placed
the separate packets of manuscript in different
envelopes. The first and largest he addressed
in a bold clear hand, ‘<i>To Mrs Philip Hadleigh.
To be opened after my death.</i>’</p>

<p>Over the second packet his pen was poised
for some moments, and his hand was not so steady
as before when he began to write.</p>

<p>‘<i>To my son, Philip Hadleigh. To be opened after
my death and read by him alone. When he has
read, he shall decide whether to burn at once or first
to show it to his wife. The secret of my life is
here.</i>’</p>

<p>As his pen stopped, a chill blast passed through
the room, making the lamplight waver, as if
it were about to be extinguished. Mr Hadleigh,
surprised, raised his head slowly, and slowly
looked round.</p>

<p>The window behind him was open, and before
it stood a tall, rough-looking, muscular man. Mr
Hadleigh’s sallow cheeks became more sallow,
his eyes started, and his lips trembled slightly.
He recovered himself instantly, and rising calmly
from his seat, and at the same moment lifting
the shade from the lamp, his eyes remaining fixed
all the time on the intruder, burglar, intending
murderer, perhaps.</p>

<p>When the light was uncovered, the man drew
back a pace with a kind of growl of surprise.
Mr Hadleigh retained perfect self-possession; but
he was not much relieved from apprehension
by recognising in his midnight visitor the leader
of the agricultural agitators who had on various
occasions openly declared antagonism to the
master of Ringsford.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_LITTLE_KNOWLEDGE_NOT_DANGEROUS">A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE <i>NOT</i> DANGEROUS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A remarkable</span> circumstance recently occurred
which brings out strongly the fact that scientific
teaching in medical and surgical matters has
made giant strides of late. On the 8th of July
an accident happened to a ‘marker’ at the
ranges of the Civil Service Rifle regiment at
Wimbledon when marking at the five hundred
yards’ range. According to the report, a rifle-bullet
seems ‘to have bounded off the corner
of the target and to have entered the marker’s
breast.’ Fortunately, the great annual meeting
of the National Rifle Association was to commence
in a day or two, and the Field Hospital
prepared for the meeting was being got ready
under the charge of Sergeant Monaghan and
Corporal Melville, both of the Army Hospital
Corps. Thither the wounded man was immediately
carried; but there was no surgeon present
or anywhere near. Seeing, however, the serious
nature of the case, the two soldiers, without a
moment’s hesitation, took steps to extract the
bullet, which had entered the right breast just
under the collar-bone. Having carefully examined
his patient and found the exact locality of
the bullet, Sergeant Monaghan, with the assistance
of the corporal, made an incision in the back
and was enabled at once to extract the bullet
from the spot where it had lodged, just opposite
to the point of entry in the breast. The
injured man, a member of the corps of Commissionaires,
expressed himself much gratified with
the prompt attention he had received, as well
as with the skilful operation by which, without
a moment’s loss of time, the important act of
removing the bullet had been accomplished.
Too much praise cannot be given to the two
soldiers, who by their ready and intelligent action,
saved their patient not only from prolonged
suffering, but perhaps even from death itself.</p>

<p>The well-known saying of ‘A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing,’ is here singularly confuted,
for it was just the ‘little knowledge’ applied with
sagacity and intelligence that probably saved the
life of a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Many of our readers will doubtless remember
a melancholy occurrence which took place last
year on one of the Swiss mountains, when a
valuable young life was lost for the want of a
‘little knowledge,’ and in itself, very simple
knowledge too. A German engineer and two
guides were ascending one of the famous Swiss
mountains, when the younger of the guides
appears to have had a very bad fall, by which
either a bottle or a lamp-glass was broken, the
fractured part entering the young man’s thigh
and dividing the femoral artery. It would not,
we should suppose, have required very profound
surgical knowledge to know that the man would
inevitably bleed to death unless this great artery
could be immediately compressed; but incredible
as it may appear, neither the German nor the
other Swiss guide knew anything about the
matter. They tried to stop the spouting blood
with their handkerchiefs, which of course was of
no avail. Neither thought of tying the handkerchief
or other ligature round the upper part of the
limb, and then twisting it tight by the application
of a stick; and so the poor young fellow
quickly bled to death. Now, if the bleeding
could have been arrested by ligature until surgical
assistance was procured, the young guide
would doubtless have recovered, for the injury,
as a mere flesh-wound, was in itself by no means
serious. Here, then, a ‘little knowledge’ would
have done a vast amount of good.</p>

<p>One of the best, most useful, and practical
associations of the present day is the St John’s
Ambulance Society, which teaches all who care
to learn how to act in such emergencies as that
related, and to take instant action <i>on the spot</i>,
until surgical aid can be obtained—a ticklish
and anxious time, often fraught with serious
danger, when there is not a minute to spare,
and where loss of time means loss of life.</p>

<p>Let every one, therefore, who has any real love
for his fellows, and who feels that he or she has
the nerve requisite for the work—for this is a
<i>sine quâ non</i>—at once learn how to act in cases
of sudden accident, illness, faintness, drowning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">{617}</span>
or any other of the many unlooked-for ills and
mishaps that ‘flesh is heir to’—a species of knowledge
that will improve the mind of the possessor,
and may be productive of infinite good.</p>

<p class="ph3">A MODERN ROMANCE.</p>


<h3>III.—KING CHARLES III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were great preparations at Balquhalloch
Castle for the worthy reception of the king; and
but for the fact that the editor, who was also
the sole reporter, of the Aberdumble <i>Warder</i> was
at the time confined to his house from indisposition,
the whole matter would no doubt have found
its way into the papers. The Princess spared
neither trouble nor expense. Two Aberdumble
carpenters arrived, and erected opposite the
porter’s lodge a wooden triumphal arch. An
Aberdumble painter followed after them, and
inscribed upon the arch, in large red letters on
a blue ground, a legend welcoming His Majesty
to his own again. And when the painter had
departed, the Princess, accompanied by Tom Checkstone
and Father M‘Fillan, drove into Aberdumble
and hired all the flags in the town. She
also subsidised the local brass band, the members
of which she instructed to be at the castle at
a given hour, prepared to play at her behest the
stirring strains of <i>Who’ll be King but Charlie</i>, and
as many other Jacobite tunes as they knew or
could learn meanwhile; and she further engaged
four pipers, who were to stand just within the
castle gate and salute her royal nephew in
their most tremendous style. It must be confessed
that the Princess was a trifle indiscreet.
She undoubtedly laid herself open to a prosecution
for treason-felony, if not indeed for treason
of the highest and most deadly type; but fortunately
for her, the Aberdumble people had grown
accustomed to her eccentricities, and not a soul
dreamt of gainsaying her will and pleasure in
the matter. She therefore returned with a
carriage-load of flags, which she caused to be
festooned from the battlements. In her own
boudoir and with her own fingers, she had long
since worked in silk a faithful copy of the old
royal standard of Scotland, and this she ordered
to be run up on the flagstaff that surmounted
the keep, whenever the king should set foot
within the castle walls. Furthermore, she directed
that at that auspicious moment her head-butler,
assisted by one of her stable-boys, should begin
the firing of a royal salute from an old brass
gun that stood upon the western wall; and in
order to provide for this, she purchased in Aberdumble,
Archie M‘Pherson the ironmonger’s entire
stock of sporting-powder.</p>

<p>Betimes there came a telegram for the Princess.
‘Shall be with you,’ it ran, ‘at noon to-morrow;’
and it had been despatched by Charlie from the
telegraph office in Fleet Street, London.</p>

<p>The Princess passed the night in a state of
the utmost excitement. Instead of retiring to
rest, she paced to and fro until daylight began
to dawn; and it was only at Tom’s urgent
entreaty that she then consented to repair to
her boudoir and lie down for a few hours. She
had talked of attempting to raise the country
side, and of going to the railway station at the
head of her kilted and armed retainers, to welcome
her nephew; but Father M‘Fillan’s more
sensible counsel prevailed. He pointed out that
nothing could be gained by undue haste, and that
any ill-advised display of force would probably
end in the speedy collapse of the movement long
ere it could ripen and bear good fruit. The fact
is that, but for the common-sense of the chaplain,
the Princess would have done a thousand
rash deeds. Fortunately, he had constituted
himself her temporal as well as spiritual adviser;
and being a man of extraordinary kindness and
goodness, he had easily won the Princess’s confidence.
He regarded her as a harmless maniac,
and believed that there would be no danger in
humouring her within due bounds; nor did he
conceal his opinions from Tom Checkstone, who,
while professing to coincide with them, fully
made up his mind to carry on the game until
it should bring some decided advantage to himself
and his friend Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>The Princess, accompanied by Father M‘Fillan,
and by Tom, who rode, drove to Aberdumble
Station without the retinue of armed tenants;
and, punctual to the appointed hour, the king’s
train arrived. The Princess would have respectfully
kissed His Majesty’s hand; but Charlie,
with right royal condescension, embraced his
aunt and kissed her upon both cheeks. Then,
having graciously shaken hands with Tom and
the priest, he entered the carriage, which was
driven rapidly back to Balquhalloch. A few
children followed it for a short distance, but
they were soon left behind, and it was not until
the castle was well in sight that any further
signs of excitement and expectation became
visible.</p>

<p>The first loyal greeting came from Daft Andy
M‘Gregor, an old fellow of eighty-seven. He had
heard from his grandfather of the great doings
of the ’45; and fully believing that patriotism
required it of him, he stood at his cottage
door waving a rusty claymore, and flang his
bonnet into the air as the carriage rolled quickly
by. A more formal welcome awaited the king at
the gateway of the castle. The porter’s eldest son,
in his Sunday clothes, walked gravely forward,
bearing on a cushion the castle keys, and, with
profound obeisance, presented them to Charlie,
who as gravely received them and gave them
into Tom’s custody. At that moment the four
pipers struck up; and the carriage, as it passed
through the gateway, was saluted by a boom
from the old brass gun. Tears stood in the
Princess’s eyes, as, giving her hand to Father
M‘Fillan, she alighted. ‘Thank heaven for this
day!’ she exclaimed devoutly; while in a louder
voice she added: ‘God save the king!’</p>

<p>The cry was taken up by all the servants and
tenants who had collected in the courtyard, and
was accentuated by a second boom from the brass
gun. Thus acclaimed, the king, supported by
Tom, walked into the great hall, and was thence
conducted by the Princess herself to his private
apartments.</p>

<p>‘The first thing,’ she whispered to him, ‘will
be to hold a council.’</p>

<p>‘Of course!’ assented Charlie. ‘We must
hold a council at once. Let me see. May Tom—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">{618}</span>
mean Mr Checkstone—act as my private
secretary until I can appoint some one else to
the post?’</p>

<p>‘Most certainly! Your Majesty’s wishes are
commands. I will send Mr Checkstone to you.’
And the amiable Princess respectfully kissed
her nephew and retired.</p>

<p>A minute later, Tom peeped in at Charlie’s door
and entered his room. The two young men at
once burst into fits of suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>‘It is really too bad!’ exclaimed Charlie.
‘You can’t imagine how difficult it has been
for me to keep my countenance.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind; you have done very well so
far,’ returned Tom. ‘I am to be your private
secretary <i>pro tem.</i>, and you are to hold a council.
I must therefore beg your Majesty to graciously
nominate your councillors.’</p>

<p>‘Whom shall I nominate? There is Father
M‘Fillan.’</p>

<p>‘And Alexander Gordon, the factor; he is a
presentable sort of fellow.’</p>

<p>‘And my aunt, the Princess.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, the constitution doesn’t permit you to
nominate women.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, we four can hold the council, if
the council must be held,’ said Charlie.—‘Now,
how am I to comport myself?’</p>

<p>‘Father M‘Fillan understands, of course, that
we are only masquerading; but you mustn’t let
him know that you have even the most distant
designs on your aunt’s money-bags, for he would
spoil the game in an instant if he did know it.
As for Sandy Gordon—to him you must be the
king, the whole king, and nothing but the king.
If I were you, I should knight him. It would
consolidate his loyalty.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll make him a baronet, if you like,’ assented
Charlie. ‘It won’t cost any more.—But what
are we to do in council?’</p>

<p>‘To decide upon your plan of action,’ said
Tom. ‘And we may as well settle that here.
The decision must be that no public steps are
to be taken at present.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so.—But don’t, Tom, push matters too
far. I only want to be able to marry Kate, you
know; and really five hundred a year from my
aunt would satisfy me.’</p>

<p>‘All right, old fellow; you shall have a thousand.—But
now to business. I will go and
announce the nomination of councillors. The
council will meet in the drawing-room in half
an hour. Shave yourself, and make yourself look
as royal as possible. There was to be a valet
to wait upon you, but he hasn’t yet arrived
from Edinburgh.—How they are pounding away
with that absurd brass gun! Fortunately, the
powder has almost run out, so you won’t be
troubled with your full salute.’ And Tom disappeared.</p>

<p>The first sitting of King Charles III.’s council
was not a long one. The decision at which
Charlie and Tom had already arrived was, of
course, adopted. Sandy Gordon was offered, but
modestly declined, the honour of knighthood;
and Father M‘Fillan was commissioned to inform
the Princess that the king did not deem it
expedient for the present to take any public
steps to assert his authority beyond the loyal
precincts of Balquhalloch.</p>

<p>The Princess, who for nights had been dreaming
of rebellion, was grievously disappointed, and
sought to bend her nephew’s determination.
After dinner, when for a short time she was
alone with him, she talked the matter over.</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear aunt,’ said the king at last,
‘I need not tell you that if we organise a rising,
I must put myself at the head of it. And if I
put myself at the head of it, I must of necessity
risk my life. At present, as you know, I
am not married. I am the last male of our house.
Ought I not, before facing the danger, to look
to the interests of my race, and indeed of the
country? If I had a son, or even a daughter,
I could go forth with a lighter heart to battle;
for in that case my death would not mean the
inevitable extinction of all our hopes. You, it
is true, would succeed me, but only for a few
short burdensome years; and with you the line
would pass out of existence.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ assented the Princess; ‘you certainly
ought to marry, and to marry quickly. But
whom can you marry? Who is worthy of you?
Your royal grandmother was a Tudor, a worthy
spouse for my father of sacred memory. But
there are no Tudors now; and besides, you
ought not to marry a cousin. I fear that you
must seek an alliance on the continent, among
the Bourbons or the Hapsburgs.’</p>

<p>‘Why not among the English Plantagenets?’
asked the king.</p>

<p>‘Would that some remained,’ ejaculated the
Princess.</p>

<p>‘But one does remain,’ said Charlie. ‘The
fact is that I have had the good fortune to make
the acquaintance of one whom I have determined
to wed; and, my dear aunt, she is a Plantagenet.
Mr Checkstone, who has the honour of her
acquaintance, will tell you about her.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ exclaimed the Princess. ‘This news
greatly rejoices me. Let Mr Checkstone write to
her at once in my name and ask her to come
and visit me. I will judge of her worthiness.’</p>

<p>‘You had better write,’ suggested the king.
‘Why not write informally, as my aunt. You
must remember that we cannot yet afford to
risk anything by publicly hinting at my pretensions,
much less by boldly proclaiming to the
country and the powers that be that I intend to
seize the crown.’</p>

<p>The Princess reflected; but she gave way,
and, for once in her life, signed herself simply
Henrietta Maria Stuart.</p>

<p>In due course Kate received the invitation.
It was accompanied by a private letter from
Charlie; and when she had read the two communications,
she forfeited a month’s salary and
quitted her situation. A few days had to be
spent in preparing for the visit to so large and
grand an establishment as she knew Balquhalloch
to be; but in less than a week after hearing from
Miss Stuart, Catharine Plantagenet left London
for Scotland.</p>


<h3>IV.—THE COLLAPSE.</h3>

<p>The Princess was charmed with Catharine
Plantagenet, who, in truth, was as gentle and
true-hearted a girl as could be met with anywhere;
but when she became fully aware of
the deception to which she was a party, it
was with the greatest difficulty that Charlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">{619}</span>
persuaded her to refrain from telling her proud
hostess the secret of her birth.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Catharine, ‘under any circumstances
I won’t consent to take advantage of your
aunt’s weakness. I hate false pretences. Your
aunt ought to do something for you, I confess,
but let her do it with her eyes open.’</p>

<p>Ere long, however, the Princess, upon her own
initiative, made a proposition to which even
Catharine saw no objection.</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ she said one morning, ‘I am getting
old, and since you have been here with me, I
have begun to feel that I should not like to be
without you. Now I know perfectly well that
Charles will be glad to stay here for the present;
so, why don’t you make up your minds to marry
and stay here together? When I die, the castle
and everything belonging to it will be his. You
need never regard yourselves, therefore, as trespassers
upon my hospitality.’</p>

<p>‘And you really like to have me with you?’
asked Catharine.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my dear.’</p>

<p>‘For my own sake, I mean?’ added Catharine.</p>

<p>‘Yes, for your own sake, and quite apart even
from the fact that Charles loves you. I shall
speak to him about it.’ And speak to him she
did.</p>

<p>‘You will be quieter and better off here than
in London,’ she said; ‘and you will be able to
mature your plans for the future. You and
Catharine shall have a separate establishment for
yourselves; there is plenty of room for all of
us. And if you have any hesitation on the score
of money matters—which, after all, trouble the
highest as well as the lowest—I may set your
mind at ease, my dear Charles, by telling you
that I have determined to give Catharine on
her wedding-day a hundred thousand pounds
by way of jointure. When I die, the rest will
be yours.’</p>

<p>‘You are very good, aunt,’ exclaimed the king,
who was fairly overcome by his relative’s liberality.
‘Yes; nowhere can we be happier than
here. But let us be married quietly.’</p>

<p>‘By all means! Father M‘Fillan shall perform
the ceremony in the chapel. Get Catharine to
name a day—the sooner the better.’</p>

<p>Charlie talked over the matter that very evening
with his sweetheart, and an arrangement
was soon come to between them. The wedding
was fixed for an early date; a few favoured
guests were invited; and in due course Charlie
and Catharine became man and wife, Tom acting
as best-man, and Sandy Gordon, who,
on account of his age and patriarchal beard,
seemed to be peculiarly fitted for the part, giving
away the bride. There was, of course, a feast
for the tenantry; and the brass gun on the
wall was again fired—this time until it burst;
but, as the Princess regretfully said, the ceremony
was not worthy of the event. It ought to
have taken place at Holyrood or Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>Charlie and Catharine went to Edinburgh for
their honeymoon; and when they returned to
Balquhalloch, the castle settled down once more
into its normal condition of peace and quietness.
Tom and the Princess spent much of their time
in the library, working hard at the family history;
and the young couple, with nothing to
worry them, and only themselves to think about,
passed a delightful existence, which seemed as if
it could never become wearisome.</p>

<p>But matters could not go on for ever in this
way. The Princess in time began to ask Charlie
about his plans. ‘Will arms be required?’ she
wanted to know. ‘Will there be uniforms for
the troops? What hope is there of foreign assistance?
Can the officers and men throughout the
country be bribed?’ And above all, ‘When are
you going to rise and strike for your rights?’
In short, the situation threatened to become
critical. And when, nearly a year after his
wedding, Charlie found himself the proud father
of a boy, he realised that he must either act, or
permit his good aunt to scorn him as a weak-kneed,
cowardly shadow of a king.</p>

<p>The auspicious event caused the Princess to
be unusually active. She desired, ere the grand
stroke should be dealt, to be in a position to
publish abroad a full and complete pedigree,
tracing the descent of the Stuarts of Balquhalloch
from the royal Stuarts of Scotland; and
hearing that a number of old records bearing
upon the question were for sale in London, she
despatched Tom Checkstone thither with <i>carte
blanche</i> to buy whatever he could lay his hands
upon. Tom was absent for ten days; and when
he reappeared, he had with him a large chest
full of dusty, mouldy, discoloured documents.
These treasures were conveyed to the library,
and for a week the Princess almost lived among
them.</p>

<p>One day Charlie and Catharine, who was now
convalescent, were sitting at luncheon, when,
without warning, the Princess burst into the
room. She was very violently excited. Her
gray hair had fallen loose, her cheeks were pallid,
and her hands were clenched convulsively.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ exclaimed Charlie and
Catharine, both rising together and rushing to
support their aunt.</p>

<p>‘Matter!’ she cried—‘matter?’ and she began
to weep hysterically.</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ implored Catharine. ‘What can
we do?’</p>

<p>But Tom, who had followed the Princess, and
who now appeared in the open doorway, soon
explained the cause of the outbreak.</p>

<p>‘Look here!’ he said, as he held out a yellow
parchment. ‘It is a terrible blow to your aunt,
Charlie. There has been some mistake. You
are not descended from the royal Stuarts at all.
A similarity of names and some careless copying
are responsible for the error.’</p>

<p>Charlie seized the manuscript, and having
hastily glanced at it, threw it aside, and went
to his aunt, who was already being attended to
by Catharine.</p>

<p>The Princess had fainted; but ere long she
recovered, and was able to tell her version of
the story. She had been completing the pedigree;
she had almost arrived at the last link,
when the whole chain had been snapped by this
hideous discovery. She would never get over the
shock. To think that after all she was a nobody!
It was too dreadful!</p>

<p>They led her to her own room, and in time
succeeded in calming her. Then, in order to
convince himself, Charlie carefully examined the
parchment. Its statements could not be gainsaid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">{620}</span>
The Stuarts of Balquhalloch had no connection
with royalty; and he would not now be required
to seize the throne of Great Britain. To him the
revelation came, it must be remarked, as a welcome
relief; but for days and weeks it made
his poor aunt miserable; and when she finally
reconciled herself to her lot, it seemed as if her
energy and pleasure in life had departed for ever.
Indeed, she never entirely got over the blow,
and at the beginning of this year she died.</p>

<p>Charlie and Catharine were with her to the
last, and she bequeathed everything to them.
Balquhalloch, therefore, is now theirs; and Tom
Checkstone, who, rightly or wrongly, regarded
himself as Charlie’s good genius, holds sway as
his friend’s secretary, man of business, chum,
and general factotum.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MONTH">THE MONTH:
<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 27th of August, the British Association
commenced its fifty-fourth annual meeting—not
this year, however, on British soil, but at Montreal
in Canada. Some hundreds of members
travelled from this country to be present at the
meeting. Both on the part of the city and of
the Dominion, the reception of the Association
has been everything that could be desired by its
members. Montreal itself raised forty thousand
dollars towards defraying the expenses of
the visit, and three hundred of the members
were, besides, received as guests into private
houses. The new President, Lord Rayleigh,
Professor of Experimental Physics in the University
of Cambridge, delivered the opening
address, in which he sketched the progress that
had been made in certain important branches
of science. The final meeting of the Association
was held on the afternoon of September 3, and
was largely attended, about two thousand persons
being present. Lord Rayleigh in addressing the
assembly, said that no meeting had been held in
which the Association had been provided with
such spacious rooms. Resolutions in favour of
the erection of a free public library in Montreal,
as a memorial of the visit, were then passed, and
a large amount of money was immediately promised
in aid of this object, among the donations
being one of ten thousand pounds. The total
money grants in favour of scientific investigations
made at the Montreal meeting were fifteen
hundred and fifty pounds. The tickets issued
for members of the Association for this session
numbered seventeen hundred and thirty, and
the money received amounted to eighteen hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>Within the last twenty-five years, and more
especially since the Franco-German war, when
the French made such good use of balloons, there
have been somewhat frequent rumours that the
problem of aërial navigation, comprised in the
possibility of guiding and propelling a balloon
in a given direction, had been solved. The
machine in each case is carefully described, and
generally it is represented as having risen gracefully
in the air, travelled about a little, and then
returned to its starting-point. Then, nothing
more is heard of it. Such an event is said
to have occurred last month in France. The
gas-vessel—it can hardly be called a balloon, for
it is cigar-shaped—is nearly two hundred feet
long. A platform is hung below, upon which
is a screw propeller, worked by a dynamo-machine
and a large rudder. This description tallies
almost exactly with the form of so-called steerable
balloons which have been constructed, tried,
and found useless by M. Giffard, M. Tissandier,
and others in previous years. The French
government have spent much money in experimental
ballooning, and this last achievement is
the result. Perhaps the authorities were obliged
to show something for the money that was being
spent, but we fear that that something is not
anything new or profitable. Until an aërial
machine be produced which shall make its way
<i>against</i> strong currents, balloon navigation will
remain as it has hitherto been.</p>

<p>Here is a clever American notion, and one
which will probably have a wide application.
It consists of a noiseless door-closer. In the
ordinary metal or india-rubber spring, so commonly
fixed to doors, the greatest energy is
exerted at first, and the door generally slams
with a noise which is very distressing to any
one with nerves. In the new arrangement, the
spring is fixed to the piston attached to a small
air-cylinder, so that as the door closes, the resistance
of the air in the cylinder checks its motion
before the terrible bang arrives. A small opening
in the cylinder then lets in the air, so that the
spring once more asserts its authority with sufficient
persuasion to gently close the door.</p>

<p>After the terrors excited by the alleged danger
of using arsenical wall-papers, it is rather a relief
to read the opinion of Mr R. Galloway, who has
written an article upon the subject in the <i>Journal
of Science</i>. ‘Has it,’ he asks, ‘ever been proved
that persons who inhabit rooms the wall-paper
of which is stained with emerald green, suffer
from arsenical poisoning?’ He then points out
that the injurious effects, if any, must be due to
the mechanical detachment of the pigment from
the paper, and that such homœopathic doses of
the substance as could be carried by the air, would
be totally different from the effects which arise
from larger doses of arsenic. Moreover, he has
made inquiry as to any cases of poisoning occurring
during the packing of this finely divided pigment—during
which operation the packers are surrounded
by clouds of its dust—and could hear of
none. Mr Mattieu Williams, a well-known writer
on Science, is also of opinion that ‘arsenical wall-papers’
are practically harmless. We are glad
to record these opinions, for the tendency of the
present time is to point out lurking dangers in
every direction, until one is apt to wonder how
our forefathers, in their happy ignorance of sanitation,
ever contrived to reach adult age.</p>

<p>At Reading, this autumn, a honey-fair is to be
held, when prizes will be distributed to beekeepers
who work on humane and advanced principles,
and also to those who can show the greatest
amount of unadulterated honey raised in a Berkshire
hive. Such a show as this is worthy of
every encouragement, for honey fetches a high
price, and so does wax, even in these days of cheap
sugar and composite candles. It thus becomes
possible for the intelligent cottager to add considerably
to his scanty means; and if he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">{621}</span>
be taught that honey can be won without periodical
destruction of bees and comb, so much the
better. There is some complaint that the newfangled
hives, efficient though they be, are too
expensive to supersede the old straw skep. The
British Beekeepers’ Association might well turn
their attention to this aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>Last year, Professor Huxley stated it as his
opinion that no act of man could possibly influence
the increase or decrease in the number of sea-fish.
This was in answer to the gloomy anticipations
of many that the herring and other
fisheries would be gradually annihilated unless
our fishermen were compelled by law to observe
certain conditions. So far as herrings are concerned,
the recent enormous catches have shown
that there are fish as good and plentiful in the sea
as ever yet came out. Last month, we saw these
fish in splendid condition being sold at the
Farringdon Fish Market, London, at one penny
per dozen. By the way, can any one explain why,
in these days of refrigerators and cheap ice, eighty-six
tons of fish should be allowed in one month
to become—at Billingsgate—unfit for human food?</p>

<p>At a flower-show at Frome the other day, prizes
were offered by Miss Ormerod, the consulting
entomologist to the Royal Agricultural Society
of England, for the best collection of food-plants
injured by insects, accompanied by samples of
the injurious creatures themselves, and a short
written account of the nature of their depredations
and the preventive measures to be adopted in
dealing with them. There was only one competitor,
Mr Herbert Haley of Frome; but the
collection which he showed was a very complete
one, and was most highly commended by Miss
Ormerod. As this was the first injurious-insect
competition in this country, and was probably
known to comparatively few persons, we need not
be surprised at the want of competitors. Ten
years ago in Paris, a similar Exhibition took place,
in which nearly four hundred competitors took
part. The exhibits included useful as well as
injurious insects, which were divided into separate
classes. Such competitions ought to be productive
of a great amount of good.</p>

<p>Recent experiments have led to the adoption
of many alterations in the torpedo system, which
is likely to play such an important part in naval
operations of the future. Hitherto, the torpedo—a
huge fish-like case to hold explosives, and containing
within itself an air-engine for propelling it
through the water—was thrust from a ship’s side
below the water-line. But it was found in practice
that it was impossible to fire the agent of destruction
in a straight line, especially if its mother-ship
were under way. In the new method, the
torpedo, which is sixteen feet long and fourteen
inches in diameter, is fitted into a steel tube just
large enough to contain the projectile. The pressure
of a key admits highly compressed air to this
tube, and the torpedo is shot out of an open port
on exactly the same principle that a pea is projected
from a pea-shooter. But in the case of the
torpedo, its little but powerful engine is set to
work the moment it reaches the water, and away
speeds the torpedo on its terrible errand.</p>

<p>Professor Tuck of New York has constructed
an electric torpedo boat, which will render submarine
warfare very terrible, if the hopes raised
by its recent trial are fulfilled. It is made of
iron, in the shape of a cigar, or rather pointed
at each end, and is thirty feet in length. It can
travel on the surface of the water, or several feet
below, at the will of its commander. The
torpedoes are carried outside the vessel, and can
be detached by the action of an electro-magnet,
when it is desired to let one rise to the surface
against any ship that may be lying overhead.
By means of attached wires, the torpedo can be
exploded when the submarine boat has retired
to a position of safety. Jules Verne’s clever
romance <i>Thirty Thousand Leagues under the Sea</i>,
seems here to come into play.</p>

<p>Under the supervision of Mr Preece, the well-known
electrician to the Post-office, an experiment
of great interest has been recently conducted at
Wimbledon, near London. The object of the
experiment was to ascertain the best method of
lighting streets by electricity, the lamps employed
being the incandescent pattern advocated by
Edison, Swan, and others. Some of the lamps
were placed singly, others on poles twenty feet
high, while at the same time the efficiency of
different kinds of reflectors was tested. The
cost is calculated to amount to one farthing per
lamp per hour for each unit of light, valued at
ten candles. Now, the cost of gas for a similar
amount of light is one-fifth of a penny, so that
the difference in expense between the two systems
is not very great. On the other hand, the
advantages of the electric light in the open air,
where no question of impure products of combustion
need come in, almost disappear; gas,
therefore, still fulfils the required conditions.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the new regulations for
the prevention of collisions at sea, which have
just been published, will have the effect of
reducing those calamities, which have of late
become fearfully familiar. The twenty-seven
articles contained in these regulations refer to
lights, sound-signals for fog, steering and sailing
rules, precautions to be adopted, and special
rules for squadrons and convoys. We may call
particular attention to article nineteen, which
indicates how one vessel can signal to another
by a steam-whistle. Thus—one short blast to
mean, ‘I am directing my course to starboard;’
two short blasts, ‘I am going to port;’ three to
mean, ‘I am going full speed astern.’ Any one
will readily remark how such signals could be
added to almost indefinitely. Indeed, it is simply
the method adopted in the army for flash-signalling
with the heliograph, adapted to sound-signalling
with the steam-whistle. In such a
system, unfortunately, there are few, in moments
of danger, who can keep their heads cool enough
to avoid making perilous mistakes. It is somewhat
like talking quietly when the house is
on fire.</p>

<p>About four years ago, the startling scheme of
carrying ships upon a specially constructed
railway track bodily across that little neck of
land which ties together the two Americas was
conceived by Mr Eades. This scheme was communicated
to the British Association at York in
1881, and although the idea seems a novel one,
like most engineering enterprises it can be doubtless
accomplished if investors can be made to
believe in its power of paying a good dividend.
The suggested route would require a track one
hundred and thirty-four miles in length, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">{622}</span>
must be laid with a compound railway of
extremely solid construction. The worked-out
details of the method of raising a ship on a
pontoon, transferring it to a travelling cradle, and
finally committing it to the deep once more, after
its journey on dry land, are most ingenious.
Mr Eades, who hails from the United States, is
now in England, endeavouring to interest capitalists
in his proposals.</p>

<p>The demolition of the old law-courts which
adjoined Westminster Hall, has brought into
view one of the most interesting pieces of stonework
belonging to Norman times that can be
found in London. The state of preservation
of the wall of the old hall, upon which the
marks of the mason’s tools are still visible, is
due to the circumstance, that from a very early
time it was under cover, for a cloister extended
along the whole length of the building on
this side. Mr Pearson, the architect, was lately
requested to report upon the subject, and to
suggest the best method of restoration compatible
with the preservation of this unique relic of the
reign of William Rufus; and it has been determined
to restore the cloister as it originally stood.
According to the opinion of Mr Shaw-Lefevre,
the First Commissioner of Works, the edifice
when completed will, with the Houses of Parliament
and the old abbey adjacent, form one of
the grandest groups of buildings in Europe.</p>

<p>The attractions of South Kensington Museum
have lately been added to by the opening of
a room containing a collection of antique casts,
which have been collected and arranged by Mr
W. C. Perry. This collection numbers about
three hundred specimens, which illustrate the
whole historical range of ancient art. Such a
record of the plastic art of ancient times is of
deep interest to the archæologist, as well as of
immense value to the art student. The arrangement
of the specimens is mainly chronological,
and where one or two casts are, on account of
inconvenient size, not shown in their right place,
it is in consequence of want of space. We may
venture to hope that at some not distant date,
better accommodation will be found for this
valuable and interesting collection.</p>

<p>The Great Western Railway has always been
famed for the wonderful engineering difficulties
which were grappled with by the daring Brunel,
and many evidences of his skill are apparent to
the traveller on that line. But even Brunel did
not conceive the bold idea of piercing a tunnel
twenty-six feet in diameter, and four and a half
miles in length, beneath the bed of the Severn.
But this great work has now been in progress
for some years, and the operations latterly have
been pushed forward with such rapidity by three
thousand busy men, that its completion may soon
be looked forward to. The tunnel will shorten
considerably the distance between London and
South Wales. It is constructed so as to dip
considerably towards the centre, to which point
any water will naturally gravitate. Here it will
enter a drainage subway, which will carry it to
the Welsh side, to be pumped up into the river.
The great difficulty which the workers have had
to contend with is the irruption of vast bodies
of water from local springs. The crown of the
tunnel lies at a depth of from eighty to a hundred
feet beneath the bed of the river.</p>

<p>In these days of quick communication by
telegraph and telephone, it is strange to see
how it becomes occasionally convenient to employ
‘the bird of the air’ to ‘carry the voice.’ In
Haddingtonshire, at the Penston Colliery, messages
are carried from the pits to the offices,
a distance of more than six miles, by pigeons,
and they accomplish the work in about as
many minutes. Telegrams are found to take
about an hour in executing the same business,
and telephones are inadmissible, because as yet
no plan has been found by which the sounds can
be permanently recorded.</p>

<p>In a recent lecture on Cholera and its Prevention,
Professor de Chamont called attention to
the very common and erroneous idea that tobacco-smoke,
camphor, and other strongly smelling
compounds act as disinfectants. He pointed out
that although chlorine, sulphurous acid gas, and
carbolic acid may under certain conditions be
safely regarded as true disinfectants, the best and
most efficient known is <i>fire</i>. He also, in speaking
of sulphurous acid gas, generated by burning
sulphur, showed that a ready way of facilitating
combustion was first of all to pour upon
the brimstone a little alcohol.</p>

<p>Mr Graham, who recently gave an account of
his mountaineering experiences in the Himalaya,
seems to have negatived some of our preconceived
notions regarding the difficulty of breathing at
high altitudes. At an elevation of more than
four miles above the sea-level, Mr Graham and
his companions felt no inconvenience in breathing
except what might be expected from the muscular
exertion they had gone through. Loss of sight,
nausea, bleeding at the nose or ears, and other
unpleasant symptoms often described by travellers,
were entirely absent. But the heart was sensibly
affected, its rapid pace being easily perceptible,
and its beatings quite audible. It may be remembered
that Mr Glaisher and Mr Coxwell, in the
course of an experimental balloon ascent some
years ago, nearly lost their lives by the effect
upon their breathing organs of the highly attenuated
atmosphere to which they had risen. But
the altitude then reached was about double that
attained by Mr Graham in the Himalaya.</p>

<p>A scheme has been proposed for the construction
of an Indo-European railway, the chief
novelty of which is the adoption of a route
along the south shore of the Mediterranean. The
line would utilise the railroads of France and
Spain. Then there would be steam-transit from
Gibraltar Bay to Ceuta in Morocco. Here would
be the terminus proper of the international railway,
which would be in connection with the
lines already laid in Algeria and Tunis. The
route would be continued through Tripoli to
join the Egyptian lines, and eventually along
the coast of the Persian Gulf to Kurrachee in
India. Here, of course, contact would be made
with the great Indian railway system. Preliminary
surveys have been already made, and the
nominal capital of the undertaking is fixed at ten
millions sterling.</p>

<p>At the late meeting of the British Association
in Canada, a very curious contribution to our
knowledge of carnivorous plants was made by
Professor Moseley, as a result of certain experiments
he has made with the water-weed <i>Utricularia
vulgaris</i>. This plant is furnished with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">{623}</span>
small pear-shaped bladders, which at certain
seasons are charged with air, and cause the weed
to rise to the surface of the water. This movement
has hitherto been supposed to be connected
with the phenomenon of fertilisation. But Professor
Moseley points out that each bladder has
an opening closed by an elastic door, which will
easily yield to the pressure of a small fish; and
that any unfortunate intruder is either caught
bodily, or can be securely held a prisoner by head
or tail until dead. That there is here anything
analogous to digestion as seen in other
carnivorous plants, such as the <i>Dionæa</i>, &amp;c.,
does not appear; but it is thought probable that
the decomposing animal matter may contribute
eventually to the life of the weed.</p>

<p>An invention of considerable importance in
connection with the probability of saving life at
sea has made its appearance during the month.
This consists of an adaptation of the use of oil at
sea to the ordinary life-buoy. Round the inside
of the buoy is a brass reservoir filled with oil.
This is so arranged that when the buoy is hung
upon the vessel’s side no oil can escape; while
the moment it assumes a horizontal position, as,
for instance, when it is thrown into the sea, the
oil flows freely, and the water all around the buoy
is rapidly covered with a thin film. This soon
widens into a large circle, within which, of course,
the waves are unbroken, which enables persons
to be the more easily secured by the ship’s boats.
Since it is a well-known fact that in rough
weather, when the cry ‘Man overboard!’ is
oftenest heard, life-buoys are frequently useless,
as even the strongest men are commonly
washed off them, this practical adaptation of
the use of oil at sea will probably prove of
signal importance. It could, we imagine, also
be readily applied to many of those improvised
sea-rafts and similar appliances, and render
them of great value in rough weather. It was
the fault of many of those ingenious contrivances
of this kind which were to be seen at
the Fisheries Exhibition last year, that no one
could possibly live on them in broken water, and
this objection the use of oil in this way would
certainly obviate. It should be noticed, however,
that the chief value of the invention consists
in the arrangement for the oil to flow automatically.</p>

<p>In addition to the electrically lighted colliery
in South Wales, noticed in last ‘Month,’ we hear
of another in Lanarkshire belonging to Mr John
Watson, Earnock, near Hamilton. There may
possibly be other workings thus illuminated
throughout this country; and there is no doubt
that ere long the brilliant and comparatively safe
electric light will be generally adopted underground.</p>

<p>In Prussia also, as we learn from a contemporary,
the electric light at the Mechernich Mines
has now had a fair trial for more than three
years, and has proved a complete success. The
expectation that it would both facilitate the
operations and increase their security, has fully
been realised, and an extension of the plant is
now being carried out. An open working two
thousand feet long, one thousand feet wide, and
over three hundred feet deep, in which three
hundred men and twenty horses are continually
occupied, was first to be supplied with the electric
light, and it was a question whether arc lamps
would answer for this purpose in the smoky
atmosphere caused by blasting operations. For
the first experiments, arc lamps of three thousand
and one thousand candles were used, with the
positive carbon in the lower holder. The effect
was brilliant, yet the light did not penetrate the
white smoke cloud which collects at the upper
wall immediately after the shot. But as the
smoke settles within ten minutes, it was thought
advisable to acquiesce in this interruption of a
few minutes, and to use smaller lamps of three
hundred and fifty candles, which proved quite
efficient. Of these, there are ten in use, with
about ten thousand feet of lead cable, the cable
being partially elastic, as the lamps with their
wires have to be removed when the blasting is
to take place. The lamps were originally supplied
with hexagonal lanterns with obscured glass to
protect the eyes of the miners. The glasses were,
of course, soon broken, but no complaints are
said to have been made about the naked electric
lights.</p>

<p>The speech-recorder would appear to be an
instrument of no small importance, if it is able
to do in a practical manner that which the title
of a patent recently applied for by Mr W. E.
Irish would lead us to suppose. The title of
the patent is as follows: ‘A system or method
and means of receiving and recording articulated
speech and other sounds transmitted telegraphically,
telephonically, or otherwise, by the aid
of electricity.’ The transmitting, as by telephone,
and recording of speech in characters which may
be easily read, would be of incalculable value. If
this instrument fulfils what is claimed for it,
the anticipations once hoped for in the phonograph
will be realised, and in the future we
may expect to see business-men talking their
correspondence into a box in which mechanism,
by the aid of electricity, records the same on
paper, which may be forwarded as a letter.
Moreover, literary men will be saved the drudgery
of the pen, and have their thoughts recorded
as rapidly as they can convey them to the
instrument. The system of natural phonetic
signs, which we should expect this instrument
to describe, may also be the means of influencing
spelling and of simplifying the phonographic
difficulties of the language. Applications innumerable
suggest themselves to us to which such
an apparatus may be applied; the verifying
and duplicating of orders received and sent
telephonically, would form no small item in
the advantages to be derived from such a
system.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Journal de Rouen</i>, quoting
from the <i>Polytechnische Zeitung</i>, the recent invention
of M. Verk, by which is produced the effect
of any metal on felt, is likely to become extremely
useful when applied to theatrical stage properties,
as, besides being inexpensive, the articles
so treated are not materially increased in weight.
The things intended to assume a metallic appearance
are first of all covered with a layer of felt,
which is coated over with a resinous substance
mixed with plumbago or blacklead. This is left
to dry, and is then passed over with a hot iron.
The article is next rubbed with pumice-stone,
which produces the effect of burnished steel.
If copper, bronze, or silver is wished to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">{624}</span>
imitated, the felt—which is rendered a conductor
by its coating—is covered readily by immersion
in a galvano-plastic bath.</p>

<h3>TELEGRAPHING EXTRAORDINARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A contemporary</span> supplies some interesting particulars
as to the number of words transmitted
by telegraph to all parts of the kingdom on the
occasion of the Prime Minister’s recent visit to
Edinburgh. On the evening of Mr Gladstone’s
arrival, press messages containing over seventeen
thousand words were handed in at the telegraph
department of the General Post-office; but the
actual number of words transmitted was over
sixty-seven thousand, owing to the fact of the
same report being sent to more than one newspaper.
Mr Gladstone’s visit to the Forth Bridge
works led to the transmission of twelve thousand
words, and his movements on the following day
to nineteen thousand. On the occasion of his
first speech on Saturday evening (August 30)
in the Corn Exchange, sixty-two thousand four
hundred and seventy-one words were handed in,
and one hundred and thirty-eight thousand four
hundred and forty-five transmitted. The number
would have been greater had not Sunday intervened,
allowing of the transmission of many
messages by train. On Monday evening (September
1) the press messages reached the enormous
number of one hundred and seventeen thousand
words, causing the transmission of about four
hundred and twenty-seven thousand words, the
largest number ever transmitted on any one
night from Edinburgh. After the Waverley
Market speech of Tuesday night (September 2),
one hundred and seventy-two thousand eight
hundred and twenty-one words were transmitted.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, when the strain was
heaviest, one hundred and thirty operators were
at work, and in spite of the constant stream of
messages the department kept abreast of the
reporters. As many as four towns in the same
telegraphic circuit were enabled to read almost
the same message at the same time. The message
having been ‘punched’ on long slips of prepared
paper, the plan was adopted, instead of running
it entirely through one machine, of taking the
slip out of the first machine after it was three
yards clear, and running it into a second and a
third.</p>


<h3>CASUALTIES ON THE BRITISH COAST.</h3>

<p>A blue-book on sea-casualties to British vessels
from July 1, 1882 to June 30, 1883, contains the
Report of the Marine Department of the Board
of Trade, showing that the total number of vessels
belonging to the United Kingdom to which
casualties occurred (total losses and serious and
minor casualties) was 5409. This is higher by
one hundred and eleven than in 1881-82,
when it was 5298, and higher than any year
since 1876-77, when it was 5801. The number
of total losses was eight hundred and ten
(tonnage 277,490). This is lower than the
previous two years, but higher than in either
of the four years preceding. The decrease in the
last two years is in sailing-vessels (classed and
unclassed) and in unclassed steamships. There
is, however, a large increase (twenty-five per cent.)
in the total losses of classed steamships. The
number of serious casualties not amounting to total
losses was 1268, and was lower than any of the
previous six years, except 1879-80, when it was
slightly higher. The decrease is entirely confined
to sailing-vessels. The number of steamships (five
hundred and seventy-one) to which serious casualties
occurred is larger than in any of the previous
six years, and the tonnage of the vessels
affected is nearly one hundred and fifty thousand
more than in 1876-77. From 1877-78 there is
a steady annual rise in serious casualties to steamships
from four hundred and six in 1877-78 to
five hundred and seventy-one in 1882-83. In
1876-77 they were four hundred and ninety-three.
The loss of life in vessels belonging to the United
Kingdom was 2501 in 1882-83, or seven hundred
and seventy-six less than in 1881-82, but was
more than the loss in each of the five years
preceding 1881-82, and was three hundred and
thirty-one more than the average for the six
years. Of these 2501 lives, 1463 were lost in
missing vessels. The number of missing ships
was one hundred and fifty-two, namely: Sailing-ships,
133; tonnage, 32,995; lives lost, 1080:
steamships, 19; tonnage, 14,626; lives lost, 383—total
lives lost, 1463.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
